Hello World - Ruby
==========================

Introduction
------------

This Ruby on Rails program is a quick way to getting a rails app authenticating with the OAuth2 service and then pulling data from the REST api. If you don't have piles of expience with Rails check out the detailed [hello world tutorial][2]. If you want to do things the hard way, the interesting bits are in the `app/controller/sessions.rb`, the `config/initializer/omniauth.rb` and the `config/inbloom.yml` configuration file.
